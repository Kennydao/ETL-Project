Tartt was the 2003 winner of the WH Smith Literary Award for <i>The Little Friend</i>. Her novel <i>The Goldfinch</i> won the Pulitzer Prize in 2014. <br /><br />The daughter of Don and Taylor Tartt, she was born in Greenwood, Mississippi but raised 32 miles away in Grenada, Mississippi. At age five, she wrote her first poem, and she first saw publication in a Mississippi literary review at age 13.<br /><br />Enrolling in the University of Mississippi in 1981, she pledged to the sorority Kappa Kappa Gamma. Her writing caught the attention of Willie Morris while she was a freshman. Following a recommendation from Morris, Barry Hannah, then an Ole Miss Writer-in-Residence, admitted Tartt into his graduate short story course where, stated Hannah, she ranked higher than the graduate students. Following the suggestion of Morris and others, she transferred to Bennington College in 1982, where she was friends with fellow students Bret Easton Ellis, Jill Eisenstadt, and Jonathan Lethem. At Bennington she studied classics with Claude Fredericks. <br /><br />She divides her time between Virginia and New York City.", "influences": null, "works_count": "26", "gender": "female", "hometown": "Greenwood, Mississippi", "born_at": "1963/12/23", "died_at": null, "goodreads_author": null, "books": {"book": [{"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "17333223"}, "isbn": "0316055433", "isbn13": "9780316055437", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "51914"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.7THQkE1UgQ9Mj7914uwrnw", "title": "The Goldfinch", "title_without_series": "The Goldfinch", "image_url": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1378710146l/17333223._SX98_.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1378710146l/17333223._SY75_.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch", "num_pages": "771", "format": "Hardcover", "edition_information": "First American Edition", "publisher": "Little, Brown", "publication_day": "22", "publication_year": "2013", "publication_month": "10", "average_rating": "3.92", "ratings_count": "723660", "description": "It begins with a boy. Theo Decker, a thirteen-year-old New Yorker, miraculously survives an accident that kills his mother. Abandoned by his father, Theo is taken in by the family of a wealthy friend. Bewildered by his strange new home on Park Avenue, disturbed by schoolmates who don't know how to talk to him, and tormented above all by his unbearable longing for his mother, he clings to one thing that reminds him of her: a small, mysteriously captivating painting that ultimately draws Theo into the underworld of art.<br /><br />As an adult, Theo moves silkily between the drawing rooms of the rich and the dusty labyrinth of an antiques store where he works. He is alienated and in love-and at the center of a narrowing, ever more dangerous circle.<br /><br /><i>The Goldfinch</i> combines vivid characters, mesmerizing language, and suspense, while plumbing with a philosopher's calm the deepest mysteries of love, identity, and art. It is an old-fashioned story of loss and obsession, survival and self-invention, and the ruthless machinations of fate.", "authors": {"author": {"id": "8719", "name": "Donna Tartt", "role": null, "image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1409871301p5/8719.jpg"}, "small_image_url": {"@nophoto": "false", "#text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1409871301p2/8719.jpg"}, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8719.Donna_Tartt", "average_rating": "3.95", "ratings_count": "1099297", "text_reviews_count": "90589"}}, "published": "2013", "work": {"id": "24065147", "uri": "kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.6G-AEx4NIdtolFiAwDJY8A"}}, {"id": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "29044"}, "isbn": "1400031702", "isbn13": "9781400031702", "text_reviews_count": {"@type": "integer", "#text": "18534"}, "uri": "kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.4nI9LMi_gKWo4kNDfNk4Qg", "title": "The Secret History", "title_without_series": "The Secret History", "image_url": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1451554846l/29044._SX98_.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1451554846l/29044._SY75_.jpg", "large_image_url": null, "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29044.The_Secret_History", "num_pages": "559", "format": "Paperback", "edition_information": "First Vintage Contemporary Edition", "publisher": "Vintage", "publication_day": "13", "publication_year": "2004", "publication_month": "4", "average_rating": "4.09", "ratings_count": "319119", "description": "Under the influence of their charismatic classics professor, a group of clever, eccentric misfits at an elite New England college discover a way of thinking and living that is a world away from the humdrum existence of their contemporaries.
